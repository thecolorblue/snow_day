      Welcome to Snow Day! 
      
      At this point you have navigated the dashboard. Let's go over the Story UI.

      You should see a large block of text that is being highlighted in sync with the audio. This is the story panel, that shows you your progress through this page of the story. You can double tap on any word in the story panel to jump to that point in the audio. 

      To the right of the story panel is the audio speed controls. Move the slider up to speed up the audio and down to slow down the audio playback. Tapping the slider will also play and pause the audio.

      Along the bottom you will see a 'next' button and a 'previous' button if there was a previous page. The 'next' button will be disabled until all of the questions are answered on the page.

      What about questions?

      Questions in Snow Day serve multiple purposes:

      1. they keep the reader engaged with the app and the story
      2. they briefly test the vocabulary or comprehension to confirm that the profile is still correct
      3. they guide the app's algorithm to generate more relevant and engaging stories

      You can see a couple questions that are inline with the story panel. These are single word questions and answers that fit into the flow of the story. 

      There is also a comprehension multi-choice question at the bottom of the page about the page's content.

      Every story after this point will be generated by AI, based off the parameters given when it is created. Play around with different inputs to see how it affects the story. 

      You should now be ready to create a new story, read it, and adjust the parameters to explore the potential for AI to generate narratives and combine that with structured feedback to create an engaging literary experience.
