# Snow Day

## LLM generated vocabulary quizzes

Generates a story, audio, and quiz based off a set of preferences and a list of vocabulary. Quiz timing and accuracy is recorded for later. 

## Deploy

Snow Day defaults to using Inngest for background tasks, Supabase for a database, and Vercel for hosting. It is pretty easy to replace Supabase with another Postgresql host, but Inngest and Vercel are pretty tightly coupled with the code. 

All Vercel deployments are done through integration with the code host. You will want to connect Vercel to the code repository, and then Vercel can handle the deployment from there. 

## Code Structure

Most of the code right now, and all of the code eventually, will live in the `nextjs-app` folder as part of the next.js app. There are still a couple python scripts for generating and testing stories, audio and quizzes that live in the `src` or `generators` folders. 

## Development

### Inngest

Inngest has a handy CLI for starting the local function runner. You will start this up as a separate process from the next.js app.

### Next.js

The next.js app can be started in developer mode with `npm run dev`.

### Python Scripts

Python scripts were developed with Python 3.13.6. All python scripts will soon be deprecated. 


# Story Generator GCP Function

This project contains a GCP Cloud Function for generating stories based on a given storyline.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or higher)
- Google Cloud SDK
- Prisma CLI

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required to run the GCP function. These should be set in your local environment and in the GitHub repository's secrets for automated deployment.

- `GCP_SA_KEY`: A JSON key for a Google Cloud service account with permissions to deploy Cloud Functions and access other required services. To get this key:
    1.  Go to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    2.  Navigate to **IAM & Admin** > **Service Accounts**.
    3.  Click **Create Service Account**.
    4.  Give the service account a name and description.
    5.  Grant the service account the **Cloud Functions Admin** and **Service Account User** roles.
    6.  Click **Done**.
    7.  Click on the newly created service account.
    8.  Go to the **Keys** tab.
    9.  Click **Add Key** > **Create new key**.
    10. Select **JSON** as the key type and click **Create**.
    11. The JSON key file will be downloaded. The content of this file is the value for `GCP_SA_KEY`.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your API key for OpenAI.
- `DATABASE_URL`: The connection string for your PostgreSQL database. This should be in the format `postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE`.

### Google Cloud Storage Bucket

The application uses a Google Cloud Storage bucket to store the generated audio files. The `deploy.sh` script will automatically create a bucket named `story-audio-PROJECT_ID` (where `PROJECT_ID` is your GCP project ID) and set the appropriate permissions.

If you need to create the bucket manually, follow these steps:

1.  **Create the Bucket:**
    ```bash
    gsutil mb -p YOUR_PROJECT_ID -l US-CENTRAL1 gs://story-audio-YOUR_PROJECT_ID
    ```
2.  **Set Public Access:**
    ```bash
    gsutil iam ch allUsers:objectViewer gs://story-audio-YOUR_PROJECT_ID
    ```
3.  **Set Environment Variable:**
    When deploying the function, you'll need to set the `GCP_BUCKET_NAME` environment variable to the name of your bucket. The `deploy.sh` script handles this automatically.

### Local Development

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd functions
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the Function Locally:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### Deployment

The function is automatically deployed to GCP when changes are pushed to the `main` branch. To deploy manually, run the following command from the `functions` directory:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```
