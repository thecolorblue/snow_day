Story Structure Prompt:
Write a story in eight chapters, each corresponding to a step in the Dan Harmon Story Circle:

You – Introduce the protagonist in their ordinary world. Establish their life, personality, and setting.
Need – Show what’s missing in their life. This should set the stakes for the rest of the story. They desire something or are faced with a challenge that disrupts their normalcy. A magical creature or item is revealed but it is not clear to what use.
Go – The protagonist is forced to make a choice to leave their comfort zone, embarking on their journey. 
Search – They find obstacles in this new world. They fail their first challenge and must un-learn something foundational to their ordinary world to continue on their journey.
Find – They achieve what they sought and receive an item of great value (at least to them) and new knowledge that brings clarity to their ordinary world, but it comes with unexpected consequences.
Take – A major cost or sacrifice is required. The protagonist pays a price, forcing growth or change to move forward in their journey.
Return – They head back to their familiar world, with both tangible and intangible items. The journey has revealed a fundimental truth about their world that was not clear before. This new perspective makes the solution to previous problems trivial and they receive great praise for the value they can add to their community.
Change – The protagonist integrates what they’ve learned, resolving the journey with newfound wisdom or transformation.

The story should be about a family with the last name of Davis:
Aleese, the mom, loves drinking coffee, taking care of her two daughters and gossip.
Brad, the dad, loves adventures, technology, and space. He would really like an adventure in space but nobody else in the family does.
Nora, the youngest daugther at 5 years old. She loves horses, animal facts, and water slides. 
Maeve, the oldest daughter at 8 years old. She loves basketball, putting on plays, and skateboarding.
They are going on a disney cruise together. This is their first cruise and they don't know what to expect. 
The story should be silly and funny, including magical characters, some good jokes, some bad jokes, and reinforce narratives of friendship, communication, and being true to yourself.
